Given an array arr[] of size n and an integer X. Find if thereâ€™s a triplet in the array which sums up to the given integer X.

Examples:
Input: array = {12, 3, 4, 1, 6, 9}, sum = 24;
Output: 12, 3, 9
Explanation: There is a triplet (12, 3 and 9) present
in the array whose sum is 24.

Input: array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, sum = 9
Output: 5, 3, 1
Explanation: There is a triplet (5, 3 and 1) present
in the array whose sum is 9.
[9,2,5,6] target = 7

9 + x = 7 => x = 7 - 9 = -2
             x = 7 - 2 = 5
             x = 7 - 5 = 2
